Running CYPRESS tests via command line
- Running a single test: .\node_modules\.bin\cypress open  //this will open test runner 
- Running a single test: .\node_modules\.bin\cypress run --spec '.\cypress\integration\Aayush''s Tests\firstTest.js'
- Running on a browser: .\node_modules\.bin\cypress run --spec '.\cypress\integration\Aayush''s Tests\firstTest.js' --browser firefox

project structure explained
- Node modules: gets created when npm install is run
- Integration: would have test cases
- Support: would have common methods
- Fixtures: would have test data as we dont hard code test data onto a system
-cypress.json: stores overrides for default configuration
 
Locaters(need only four methods and any element can be handled)
- Cypress only supports CSS Selectors
    - id: #idname
    - classname: .classname 
        - tagname.classname
    - Any attribute (type, class, placeholder)
        - tagname[attribute=value] e.g. input[type='search']
    - Parent to child traversing(Traverse using tagnames): tagname tagname e.g. form input
- How to confirm from console if you have the locaters pinned
    - $('input[type="search"]')
